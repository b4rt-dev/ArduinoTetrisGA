# Tetris GA Arduino

A genetic algorithm for Tetris, running on an Arduino (ESP32 (TTGO-Eight)) using a SH1106 OLED display.
The goal of this project is to show in a fun way how cool reinforcement learning (part of machine learning) is.
A genetic algorithm is used, since it works pretty well with Tetris, and because it is really simple to explain.

Work in progress.
Eventually might add a second display (small oled thingy from AE) to show the status of the GA.

Project is to kill time until the PCB and components for the FPGC4 have arrived from China (which may take some time with the current circumstances)
